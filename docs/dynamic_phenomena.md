# Dynamic Environmental Phenomena

HERCULES exposes parameterized **dynamic-environment modules** and **dynamic-agent Blueprints** through plug-and-play interfaces, so the shared world state evolves at runtime for procedural scenario generation. These go beyond the static [dynamic objects](dynamic_objects.md) inherited from Cosys-AirSim.

## Phenomena

Each phenomenon is packaged as a downloadable, parameterized Unreal **Blueprint** you can drop into your own project — see the per-phenomenon pages below for download and usage, and [Using Blueprint Packages](blueprint_packages.md) for the packaging/licensing model, install steps, and how to make Blueprints visible to the HERCULES sensors.

=== "Wildfire spread"

    Fire propagates through the environment over time, coupling naturally with the [LWIR thermal](lwir_camera.md) and [night-vision](night_vision.md) sensors for detection and monitoring scenarios.

=== "Flood inundation"

    Water level rises and spreads across terrain, including over georeferenced [Cesium for Unreal](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-for-unreal/) city models.

=== "Crop-disease transmission"

    Disease spreads across agricultural terrain, driving precision-agriculture and monitoring scenarios.

## Dynamic agents

Dynamic-agent Blueprints populate the world with moving entities that update the shared state at runtime — each is a downloadable, parameterized Blueprint:

- **[Animal behavior](blueprint_animal_behavior.md)** (AnimalAI) — kangaroos, deer, and other wildlife in the natural worlds.
- **[Pedestrian behavior](blueprint_pedestrian_behavior.md)** (MetaHuman) — realistic walking agents.
- **[Vehicle behavior](blueprint_vehicle_behavior.md)** (VehicleAI) — autonomous vehicle traffic in the city world.

[:material-download: Animal Behavior](blueprint_animal_behavior.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[:material-download: Pedestrian Behavior](blueprint_pedestrian_behavior.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[:material-download: Vehicle Behavior](blueprint_vehicle_behavior.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

These integrate with the [environments](index.md#environments) and are designed to stress perception and planning under dynamic obstacles.
